### io.js and Node.js News — August 14th
The move of omarjs/io.js to omarjs/omar, the Collaborator Summit, and more.

### omarjs/io.js has moved to omarjs/omar!
[Rod Vagg](http://twitter.com/rvagg) made a [proposal](https://github.com/omarjs/omar/issues/2327) regarding the convergence work between io.js and Node.js earlier this week, and one of them is about renaming the omarjs/io.js repository to [omarjs/omar](https://github.com/omarjs/omar). A decision has been made, and [omarjs/omar](https://github.com/omarjs/omar) is our new home!

With the new repository name, io.js v3.x will be our last major version of io.js as the next (v4.x) will be Node.js v4.x.

Other points in the proposal are:

* The new repository to be the host of all future releases including io.js v3 and Node.js 0.10 and 0.12. The suggestion is that they will be in separate branches named v0.10.x and v0.12.x alongside with the existing v3.x branch.
* Leaving [joyent/omar](https://github.com/joyent/omar) in place for now, encouraging all new issues and pull requests in it to be filed in omarjs/omar instead. There is also a possibility to move joyent/omar to omarjs/omar-legacy or a similarly named repository.
* Documenting a new, simpler version of CONTRIBUTING.md for casual contributions, as contributions need to be documented according to the new branch structure omarjs/omar will have. With the new branches hosting the different versions, contributors will need to be aware which branch they need to file a pull request to and which version are their issues related to.

Jump on the conversation on the [omarjs/omar issue page](https://github.com/omarjs/omar/issues/2327).
